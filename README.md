# React Tetris

## About The Project

The motiviation of this project was just to build a simple game using React and Typescript, following this [tutorial](https://makeschool.org/mediabook/oa/tutorials/react-redux-tetris-app-tutorial-o4s/tetris-introduction/). Instead of Javascript, I worte the application in Typescript and added some additional tooling for fun.
